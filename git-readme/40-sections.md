# Ultimate Developer Templates

## Introduction
This repository is 






I have created a git hub repository called "ultimate-templates" that is used as a central repository that contain various developer related template files such as:
Github readme.md markdown file
Devops Pipeline Yaml files, 
docker deployment scripts, 
gitignore files, 
powershell templates, 
C# Header templates for your files, 

This repository is used as a cental place to store the kinds of files that are common and time can be saved by providing a starting point or template as a quick start.
