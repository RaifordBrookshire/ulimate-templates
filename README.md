# Ultimate Developer Templates

## Introduction
The **ultimate-templates** repository is a collection of various developer-related template files that can be used as a starting point or quick reference. 

For example:

- Github readme.md markdown files
- DevOps pipeline YAML files
- Docker deployment scripts
- .gitignore files
- PowerShell templates
- C# header templates for files. 

By providing a central place to store these common files, time and effort can be saved when starting new projects.


## Getting Started
Just clone the repository to have a local copy. Or you can just copy the contents directly from GitHub and paste it into your own project. *I generally do the copy and paste.*

## Team Participation
Currently this has been a good resource for my self and my teams to share ideas and templates of reusable starters.
